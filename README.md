# Language_Adapter_v2


This is an application for korean spekers to learn English quicker and easier based on my idea, what method helped me boost learning english quicker.
It starts out with a question in mind. "Why does it have to be so much money for English learning for koreans and How come it is so rare to see koreans sharing their ideas with people from diffrent countries".      

     
**To lower the barrier, my strategy is that,**          
1. To let them quit on studying from notepad in their room but bring them out to people who are actually talking in English and behaving in english.
2. Surround them with English So they can feel the situations and read rooms in English.
3. Put some support explained by korean with them so they can catch detailed tone / nuance of words being used.

  
### By doing so.
1. Link Youtube API so people look up with words and get some videos, especially news, and show them the situations the word is being used in.
2. Use a calendar, so They can revise their learning in an accumulated way.
3. Add Scapper, so they can see the usage of the word in what way or tone.
4. (If available), Serve them with the experience to talk to english speaker so they can use the terms in the actual conversations.


## Technical side
1. It will be written in Go on the server side
2. It will be written in Angular on the Client side.
